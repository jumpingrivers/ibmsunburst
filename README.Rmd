# IBM Personality Insights sunburst diagrams in R

The goal of ibmsunburst is to wrap the [javascript library that IBM have produced](https://github.com/personality-insights/sunburst-chart/) for making sunburst personality insights charts for use in R and rmarkdown documents.

## Typical htmlwidgets workflow
- :ballot_box_with_check: Identify JS source
- :ballot_box_with_check: Use htmlwidgets starter package
- :ballot_box_with_check: Add relevant JS files to inst
- :ballot_box_with_check: Include a sample dataset
- :ballot_box_with_check: Adjust templates to incorporate JS lib
- :ballot_box_with_check: Prep any data transformation or specifications needed
- :white_large_square: Add testing and documentation
- :white_large_square: Prepare for CRAN


Fixed some integration issues

- timelyportfolio/sunburst-chart@4b1ef69 - use d3v4 version
- timelyportfolio/sunburst-chart@8aa4f37 - RStudio Viewer will be updated but as of now requires es5 JavaScript since it is a very outdated. Change .babelrc to target es5 and transpile Object.assign.
- timelyportfolio/sunburst-chart@97a5c13 - babel the dist version which we use in htmlwidgets/lib
